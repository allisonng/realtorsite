            <p><h2>About Us</h2>
            Our experience working and living in East Vancouver has allowed us to see a ton of homes, and as a result we know what buyers want and what sellers can command on the open market.

            <br><br>In order to provide our clientele with the best advice and service we asked ourselves the only question that mattered: If we were selling our houses, what would we want from our Real Estate agents?

            <br><br>This is what they have come up with:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Day to day life is busy:</b>&nbsp; From start to finish the process should be simple, and seamless.</li>
                <li><b>Where do you start?</b>&nbsp; It's about considering the big picture while taking care of the small details. That's why professional photography, measurements, staging, a lick of paint, and cleanup is included.</li>
                <li><b>Right place, Right time: </b>&nbsp; Follow a transparent, time tested marketing strategy.</li>
                <li><b>Can you hear me?</b>&nbsp; We are all unique so we know its important to be listened to, we hear you!</li>
                <li><b>What nowâ€¦</b>&nbsp; When you hire professionals, trained in the art of negotiation you won't be left in the dark looking for answers; you'll have them.</li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>Our goal is to give you the most professional Real Estate experience ensuring you get the best results while protecting and communicating with you the entire time.

            <br><br>Choose us for your next real estate transaction!

    "The search for my investment property began early 2015 when I was referred to Sean by a close friend
    of mine in Vancouver. The initial stage of my research was especially challenging as I'm based offshore,
    which made physical inspection challenging in a fast moving market. Sean was keen and quick to assist,
    and he was very diligent in tailoring the search to my requirements. He provided timely and thorough
    analysis on properties that I showed interest in, and I was especially impressed by his proactive attitude.
    I felt Sean really tried to understand my needs, and offered his honest opinion on the suitability of the
    property to me as the potential buyer. Sean was integral in helping me find my property, and continued
    to be helpful during the entire purchasing process. I'm very happy with his services and professionalism,
    and would not hesitate recommending him to anyone I know."

    "In 2015, I was working with my financial planner on purchasing a condo for my daughter. It
    was suggested to me that their lending channel could help me accomplish this but when we got into
    it, I found I wasn't getting the pertinent information that I needed and I had lost 2 weeks. A
    friend suggested I contact Sean Patterson to look into things and right from the start I found
    him to be honest, direct, and informative. He was able to answer all my questions and dealt with
    my requests in a timely manner. He ended up getting me the mortgage financing I was looking
    for and in a way that never left me asking what step was next. As we approached the completion
    date, due to the time constraints I ended up having an unexpected delay on a funds transfer of
    investments I had liquidated. I called Sean, first and the guy offered to lend me the $20,000.00 for a
    few days so that I could complete on time. THIS BLEW ME AWAY! In the end, I didn't have to go
    that route, and I was able to get my money just in time to close the deal. Working with Sean was a
    pleasure, and Ilook forward to working with him again. I would highly recommend him to anybody I
    know."
